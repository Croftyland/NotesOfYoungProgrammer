# Hi everyone!

Let me introduce myself. My name is Khrystyna. I'm a frontend engineer that **never gives up when it goes wrong**. It's the first thing that you should figure out. 
What is more... I'm 

* active üë©üèª‚Äçüè´
* core member of [Kottans](https://kottans.org), [React Kyiv](https://www.meetup.com/Kyiv-ReactJS-Meetup/)
* speaker in conferences based on Javascript
* program committee for [fwdays](https://fwdays.com) 
* all about me can be found by `@croftyland`

I know how it's hard to start something when you are newbie. Lots of recourses persuade you that you can be a professional programmer as quick as it possible. 
But I should say that's it wrong and start to forget such idea as quick as it possible. 

## This is not a story to study alone. 

I think that was my the biggest mistake. It took more than **3 years** of understanding these words. I really wish I could to start my career right now after being mentor. I made code review to my student and gave piece of advice where she should gain her knowledge for better understanding concept of programming. And she reached the results more faster than me in my time. 

Summing up my recommendation: 
* First of all **find community** with same aims and goals. 

It will be much easier to start from scratch and deal with challenges. 
* Then **accept the moments** that it's really hard to dealing with criticism to your side.

Just calm down and carry out. **Listen to it** and try **make lessons** from it. **Nobody wants to hurt you** and your feelings. I know how valuable constructive can be. It's one of items of study and there is **nothing awful or terrifying with it**. 

`If you are not ready with it, maybe it's not your type? There are lots of branches in IT sphere and I know for sure that you will find your way.` 

Ask your self what do you really want and as I mentioned before **do not study alone**.

## So, you are ok to critics, ready to start over and over again, found a community and here is another questions comes to you: 

1. Where to start my roadmap?
2. Where to find proper materials for me? 

In an effort to answer the first question, there is a perfect [illustration](https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps). It will help you to organise your first necessity.

Another question is quite tricky but I'll try my best to help you. In this repo you could find articles, books, sites, courses which helped me when I started my way of becoming a programmer. 

## Remember: Each of you are individual. Accept yourself just way you are, no matter what. 

Start to realise that you **need time to cope with large amount of materials**, **make lots of practices**.

## But it is nothing compared with interview.

Be good programmer and solving tasks is one thing but be calm and perfect at interview it's another talk. It's another skill which you should gain. 
**Here my mission comes to help you.** I have a large amount knowledge of passing an interview. Some of them successful, some not. 

Do I get depressed? Of course, I do! 

But **I'm not scary to share it** with you. All **my failure** I take as a **game**, should try again if I really want it | be in company where I wish to be with all my heart.

It's a type of realising that I have some **gaps** and I need to **remove** as quick as possible. Also, I have noticed that I'm not good at **formulating sentences** at all.  Mostly, I consider myself a practitioner rather than theorist. If I wanted to pass interview, I would write two-three **preparation sentences of answer** for certain question. As you understand it was full of pages and pages of information.

So, everything was leading me to **create repo with answers for question, practice** that could be | was asked during the interview in order **to get of searching** answer and **saving my time**.  

Some days ago I found **300+ JavaScript questions for interview** in [DOU](https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/interview-questions-javascript-developer/) to coming with idea for answer to all of them. Except Angular, sorry I'm not a big fan of it.

At first it's going to **be in Ukrainian** due to lack of such content. In the nearest future will be **translated into English**.    

## Wait, can I help you?

**Yes, sure!** I will be pleased if it spreads out and helps someone else. 

If you find inaccuracy of information | no answer | add question |improvements to code snippets, explanations, etc., feel free to contribute to the quality of this content by submitting PRs.

Any contributions you make to this effort are **greatly appreciated**.
